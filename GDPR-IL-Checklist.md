## Overview

| Dimension | GDPR | Israeli Privacy Protection Law |
|-----------|------|-------------------------------|
| Enacted | 2018 | 1981 (amended 2023) |
| Regulator | National DPAs + EDPB | Privacy Protection Authority (PPA) |
| Territorial scope | Anyone processing EU residents' data | Data processed in Israel |
| Max penalty | €20M or 4% global turnover | NIS 3.2M (approx. €800K) |
| Adequacy status | Israel is EU-adequate | — |

## Lawful Basis for Processing

### GDPR (Article 6)
- [ ] Consent obtained — freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous
- [ ] Contract performance — necessary for contract with data subject
- [ ] Legal obligation — required by EU/member state law
- [ ] Vital interests — protect life
- [ ] Public task — exercise of official authority
- [ ] Legitimate interests — balanced against individual rights

### Israeli Privacy Law
- [ ] Consent obtained (written consent required for sensitive data)
- [ ] Legal authority exists
- [ ] Processing serves a vital interest of the data subject

**Gap alert:** GDPR's "legitimate interests" basis has no direct equivalent in Israeli law. Israeli companies relying on this basis under GDPR cannot assume it applies domestically.

## Data Subject Rights

| Right | GDPR Article | Israeli Law | Action required |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Access | Art. 15 | Section 13 | Build access request workflow |
| Rectification | Art. 16 | Section 14 | Allow correction mechanism |
| Erasure | Art. 17 | Section 14 | Build deletion process |
| Portability | Art. 20 | Not explicit | GDPR obligation only |
| Object to processing | Art. 21 | Partial | Implement opt-out mechanism |
| Automated decision-making | Art. 22 | Not explicit | Human review process needed |

## Data Transfers

### Transferring data from EU to Israel
- [ ] Israel has EU adequacy decision — transfer permitted without additional safeguards
- [ ] Adequacy covers commercial transfers only — verify use case qualifies

### Transferring data from Israel to third countries
- [ ] Check if destination country has Israeli PPA approval
- [ ] If not approved: obtain explicit consent or use contractual safeguards

## AI-Specific Obligations

### GDPR Article 22 — Automated Decision-Making
Applies when AI makes decisions that significantly affect individuals.

- [ ] Is there solely automated processing? (no human involvement)
- [ ] Does it produce legal or similarly significant effects?
- [ ] If yes: inform individuals, allow human review, allow objection

**High-risk examples for Israeli companies:**
- CV screening and hiring decisions
- Credit scoring
- Insurance risk assessment
- Medical diagnosis without physician review

### GDPR Article 35 — Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
Required when processing is "likely to result in high risk."

- [ ] Does the AI use systematic profiling?
- [ ] Does it process sensitive data at scale?
- [ ] Does it involve innovative technology?

**→ If any apply: DPIA is mandatory before deployment.**

## Registration Requirements

### Israel (Privacy Protection Regulations 2017)
- [ ] Is a database registered with the PPA? (required for databases above threshold)
- [ ] Does the database contain sensitive information?
- [ ] Is the database used for direct marketing?

### GDPR
- [ ] Records of Processing Activities (RoPA) maintained (Article 30)
- [ ] DPO appointed if required (Article 37)
